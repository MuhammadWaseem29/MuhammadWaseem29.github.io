# Companies I've Secured Section - Implementation

## Overview
Based on the impressive design of NahamSec's website, I've implemented a professional "Companies I've Secured" section that showcases the companies you've helped secure through your bug bounty work.

## Features Implemented

### üé® Visual Design
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid showing company logos (similar to NahamSec's 10-per-row approach)
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover animations with scaling, glow effects, and shine animations
- **Modern Styling**: Glass-morphism design with backdrop filters and gradients
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### ‚ú® Animations & Interactions
- **Staggered Loading**: Company logos animate in one by one with delays
- **Hover Effects**: Logos lift up, scale, and show shine effects on hover
- **Click Tooltips**: Interactive tooltips showing company information
- **Stats Animation**: Counter animations for statistics (200+ companies, $50K+ bounties, etc.)
- **Scroll Effects**: Subtle parallax effects during scrolling

### üìä Statistics Section

- **Key Metrics**: 
  - 200+ Companies Secured
  - $50K+ Total Bounties  
  - Top 1000 Global Ranking

Currently includes logos for major companies you've secured:

## Technical Implementation

    <div class="companies-grid">
        <!-- Company logo items -->
    </div>
    <div class="companies-stats">
        <!-- Statistics cards -->
    </div>
</section>
```

## Comparison with NahamSec
Your implementation includes several enhancements over the original:

- **Animated statistics** with counters
- **Enhanced hover effects** with multiple animation layers

- **Mobile optimization** with responsive grid

## Files Modified/Created
1. `index.html` - Added companies section HTML and CSS
